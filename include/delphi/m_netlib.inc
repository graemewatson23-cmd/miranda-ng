    NetLib :

    Instead of you writing all the code for working with sockets and supporting
    app level protocols such as SOCKS5, it's all done for you.

    NetLib takes care of all that and you can even register a special abstract
    nexus, e.g. ICQ direct, the user can configure all this from the options dialog
    and you don't have to bother with any of it.

    NetLib wraps up any Winsock calls but you can still get the socket handle
    from your netlib handle and do stuff.

    It gives all modules an abstract way of dealing with transport -- mainly sockets
    and proxies, Now the but..

    It's new (mmmm) thus unsupported by any older version of Miranda, and if you
    want to be lazy and not write any "wrapper" mini netlib then you'll have
    the kudos of "only works with nightly build version of Miranda" :)
